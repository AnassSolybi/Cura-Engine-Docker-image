    # Note: The reusable workflow may show a warning about missing unit_tests_results.xml
    # This is non-critical - tests still run, but results aren't uploaded as artifacts
    # The warning occurs because CTest needs to be run with --output-junit flag
    # to generate JUnit XML, which is controlled by the reusable workflow
